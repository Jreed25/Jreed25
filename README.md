Hi, I am Jeremy Reed

I am interested in being a software engineer. I would like to be full-stack since I enjoy both back and front-end.
I am currently majoring in computer science. Proficient in C++, HTML, and Java. And I would say intermediate in CSS, Assembly Language, C, Python, and SQL. 
I am currently working on getting better with CSS and JS since I am taking a web development course, but I wish to become proficient in as many languages as possible, and I will work towards that.
I am looking to collaborate on projects working with HTML, CSS, JS, C++, and Java. 
You can reach me by number (856)-383-2158 or email at jeremyreed1452@gmail.com.
I am a he/him.
Fun fact: I actually enjoy running into problems debugging.
